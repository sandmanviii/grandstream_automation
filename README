Purpose of this project is to optimize configuration of grandstream atas.

Path needs to be changed for chromedriver as it is currently following an absolute path that is system specific.

As of now, this will only build out one profile and add authentication information for port one of ata, but can be used across any HT product.

Values that need to be changed are the number, passwd, and domain. Other values such as dns can be changed, but aren't required.
